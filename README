StaticSite is a tool for generating static sites.

The idea is you have a directory with templates, and a directory with content.
The files in the content directory specify which template their text should be
put into. The content file can be divided up into sections like "#title" and 
"#body", which are put into the template in the corresponding spots. Sections
titled #body are special because they are processed as markdown before they get
put into the template. The output files are put in an output directory that
mirrors the content directory, excecpt in html. This output folder can be
served to the web, or rsynced to a remote server, or browsed locally, or
whatever.

StaticSite is in the early stages of development so all of that is liable to
change.

Goals:
    -Template inheritance
    -Option to only generate pages that are new/updated instead of the entire
       site.
    -special markdown/tags for gists and other stuff I think is important
    -Some sort of menu maker thing?
